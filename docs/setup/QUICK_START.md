## 🔧 Install and Test Right Now (2 minutes)

### Step 1: Load the Extension
1. Open **Google Chrome**
2. Go to `chrome://extensions/` in the address bar
3. Turn on **"Developer mode"** (toggle in top-right corner)
4. Click **"Load unpacked"** button
5. Select your project folder: `PersonalRecruiter`
6. The extension should appear in your extensions list! 🎉

### Step 2: Basic Test
1. **Find the Extension**: Look for the Personal Recruiter icon in your Chrome toolbar
2. **Click the Icon**: Should open the popup (will show login screen)
3. **Test Popup**: Interface should load without errors

### Step 3: Test on Job Sites
1. Visit any of these sites:
   - linkedin.com/jobs
   - indeed.com
   - glassdoor.com/jobs
2. The extension should detect you're on a job site
3. Look for subtle notifications from the extension

## ⚠️ Expected Behavior (Without Google OAuth)

Since Google OAuth isn't set up yet, you'll see:
- ✅ **Popup loads correctly** - Shows "Sign in with Google" button
- ✅ **Extension icon appears** - In Chrome toolbar
- ❌ **Authentication fails** - Expected until you set up OAuth
- ✅ **Job detection works** - Should detect job sites

## 🔑 Set Up Google Authentication (Optional for Testing)

If you want full functionality right now:

1. **Go to**: [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. **Create Project**: "Personal Recruiter Extension"
3. **Enable API**: Search for "Google+ API" and enable it
4. **Create Credentials**: 
   - Go to "Credentials" → "Create Credentials" → "OAuth 2.0 Client IDs"
   - Application type: "Web application"
   - Authorized JavaScript origins: `chrome-extension://YOUR_EXTENSION_ID`
5. **Copy Client ID**: Update in `manifest.json`

### Get Your Extension ID:
1. Go to `chrome://extensions/`
2. Find "Personal Recruiter" 
3. Copy the ID (long string like: `abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz123456`)
