# üîí SECURITY IMPROVEMENT - Host Permissions Optimized for Chrome Web Store

## ‚ùå Issue Identified
Chrome Web Store flagged the extension for **Broad Host Permissions** requiring in-depth review:
```
- Broad Host Permissions
Instead of requesting broad host permissions, consider using the activeTab permission, 
or specify the sites that your extension needs access to.
```

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Improvements Implemented

### 1. Removed Problematic Broad Permissions
**REMOVED:**
```json
"*://*/*careers*"    // Could access ANY site with "careers" in URL
"*://*/*jobs*"       // Could access ANY site with "jobs" in URL
"*://*/*employment*" // Could access ANY site with "employment" in URL  
"*://*/*hiring*"     // Could access ANY site with "hiring" in URL
```

### 2. Replaced with Specific Site Permissions
**NOW USING:**
```json
"host_permissions": [
  "https://linkedin.com/*",
  "https://www.linkedin.com/*",
  "https://indeed.com/*", 
  "https://www.indeed.com/*",
  "https://glassdoor.com/*",
  "https://www.glassdoor.com/*",
  "https://monster.com/*",
  "https://www.monster.com/*",
  "https://ziprecruiter.com/*",
  "https://www.ziprecruiter.com/*",
  "https://careerbuilder.com/*",
  "https://www.careerbuilder.com/*",
  "https://dice.com/*",
  "https://www.dice.com/*",
  "https://stackoverflow.com/*",
  "https://remote.co/*",
  "https://www.remote.co/*",
  "https://weworkremotely.com/*",
  "https://flexjobs.com/*",
  "https://www.flexjobs.com/*",
  "https://angel.co/*",
  "https://www.angel.co/*",
  "https://wellfound.com/*",
  "https://www.wellfound.com/*"
]
```
